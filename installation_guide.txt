# INSTALLATION GUIDE open62541 for Linux based systems

1. Clone opcua from github

	git clone https://github.com/Mariunil/opcua.git


2. Install needed dependency to compile the open62541 library

 	sudo apt-get install git build-essential gcc pkg-config cmake python python-six


3. Intall dependencies that are useful for other features

	Needed for cmake GUI used in step 5

		sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui		# Needed for CMAKE GUI
	
	Optional 

		sudo apt-get install libmbedtls-dev 		# For encryption
		sudo apt-get install liburcu-dev 		# For multithreading
		sudo apt-get install check	 	        # For unit tests
		sudo apt-get install python-sphinx graphviz 	# For doc generation
		sudo apt-get install python-sphinx-rtd-theme 	# For doc's style


3. Clone master branch from github

	git clone https://github.com/open62541/open62541.git


4. Compile the library with cmake


	Naviagte to the open62541 directory, then:

	    git submodule update --init --recursive
	    mkdir build && cd build
	    cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DUA_NAMESPACE_ZERO=FULL ..


	This is the recommended cmake options at the time of writing (02-08-2019) for a default installation.
		
	This will enable the following features in 0.4:
		•  Discovery
		•  FullNamespace
		•  Methods
		•  Subscriptions

	The following features are not enabled and can be optionally enabled 

		•  Amalgamation 
		•  DiscoveryMulticast
		•  Encryption
		•  Multithreading (experimental at time of writing)
		•  Subscriptions

		NOTE: At time of writing Multithreading is at a experimental stage, and users of open62541 have reported issues caused by switching it ON.


5. Turn on additional features

	Enter the cmake configuration GUI

		ccmake..


	For simplicity, we will compile the library to a signle open62541.c/.h file. Switch on:

		A_ENABLE_AMALGAMATION


	To enable pubsub networking, switch on:

		UA_ENABLE_PUBSUB
		UA_ENABLE_PUBSUB_DELTAFRAMES
		UA_ENABLE_PUBSUB_INFORMATIONMODEL

		Note: pubsub_demo_sub.c and tutorial_pubsub_subscriber.c will not compile with AMALGAMATION turned ON.


	To generate examples and tutorials, switch on:

		 UA_BUILD_EXAMPLES

	NOTE: Examples cannot bu built when using AMALGAMATION on Rasbian

	Save configuration then Generate and exit.


6. Complete the compilation of the library

	make
	sudo make install

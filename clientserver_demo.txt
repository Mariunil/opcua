Client/Server DEMO:  simple OPC UA clinet/server communication over TCP connection.
###


This demonstrational example is a OPC UA client/server setup communicating over a TCP connection.
---
The OPC UA server is sumulating a sensor connected to a microcontroller. The sensor is counting parts passing. The client is simulating a device interested in the total number of passed parts.

The OPC UA server sets up a "Piece counter" node containing fake sensor data. 
The data models a sensor counting passings. The server utilizes a seperate thread 
to monitor "the sensor", which in reality is a loop incrementing a variable on a node
hosted by the server.

The OPC UA client sets up a connection to a OPC-UA server by a TCP connection.
The server counts parts with a sensor and updates the numberOfparts attribute 
of its "Piece counter" node. The client accesses this data and prints it.

Note:

	Use the -std=c99 flag when compiling and remember to add the open62541.c file 

		e.g. gcc -std=c99 ../lib/open62541/build/open62541.c cs_demo_server.c -o server
